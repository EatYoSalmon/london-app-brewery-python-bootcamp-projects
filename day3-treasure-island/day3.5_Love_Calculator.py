Love Calculator
100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp 2022 by Angela Yu
Coding Challenge: Day 3 Exercise 5

This is a calculator which shows you the compatablity score
between you and your crush.

It is based on a BuzzFeed article, an extra-idiotic one at that, too.

It calculates the instances of the letters in the word "true" and "love"
of your full name and your crush's full name. Add 2 parts to make a 2 digit integer
as score, then returns a reading based on the score.
